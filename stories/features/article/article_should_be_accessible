Story: articles should be accessible

  As a web site viewer
  I should be able to load an article or a group of articles
  So that I see their content

	Scenario: articles should generate a default slug
	  Given a test article titled "My Blog" created on June 15, 2008
    When I visit /2008/06/15/my-blog
    Then the page should have text "test article"

    And a test article titled "Another Post" created on June 18, 2008
