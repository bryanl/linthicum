Story: admin should login

  As a blog admin
  I should have to log in
  So that I can manage my blog

  Scenario: accessing administration section without logging in
    Given a user with login 'test' and password 'test'
    When I visit /admin
    Then I should be redirected to /admin/login    

  Scenario: logging in with invalid credentials
    Given no users
    When I visit /admin/login
    And I log in with login 'foo' and password 'bar'
    Then the page should have text "Invalid Login"

  Scenario: logging in with valid credentials
		Given a user with login 'test' and password 'test'
		When I log in with login 'test' and password 'test'
		And I visit /admin
		Then I should not be redirected
