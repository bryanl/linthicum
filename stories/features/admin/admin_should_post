Story: admin should post

  As a blog admin
  I should be able to create posts
  So that I can share new content

	Scenario: articles as a list on the administration dashboard if they exist
	  Given a user with login 'test' and password 'test'
	  And user 'test' creates 3 random articles
      When I log in with login 'test' and password 'test'
	  And I visit /admin
	  Then there should be a list with 3 articles
	
	Scenario: if there are no articles, don't display an article list
	  Given a user with login 'test' and password 'test'
	  When I log in with login 'test' and password 'test'
	  And I visit /admin
	  Then there should not be a list with articles
	
	Scenario: admin should have method to create article
	  Given a valid user
	  When I visit /admin
	  And I click the 'Create Article' link
	  Then the page should have text "Create Article"
